<p>This website is completely fake! There is no school called Christ's Chosen. I will now describe my plan to manipulate
users. I took a base template for websites and searched each of the tags I didn't know via a html help website. This
allowed me to take complete control of my webpage's functions. I decided that all I needed for an authentic webpage was
a stylish background, a solid format, and pictures of the fake thing I was presenting. I kept the menu style and the picture
above it, but changed the photo and the spacing of the titles. I then looked for a new menu banner because the menu
they had didn't fit my color scheme. I ended up photoshopping a new menu and background and putting them in the place
of the previous menu and background pictures. I created the format of my webpages by implementing the table. I also looked
at the websites of other schools to get a good sense of what a school's website would look like. What a fun project!</p>
<p>Though the link to the template creator's website is on every page, here is the link to the actual template that I 
used. I uploaded the text files of the original template and its style page to moodle.</p>
