The School of Christ's Chosen's leader is Adam 1 (pictured right). He leads us in prayer through times hard and times
good. This institution could not flourish without his love and care. He connects each of us to God in a way that we
could have never imagined. Though we thank him every day, we could never thank him enough. To be in God's favor as he is
would be heavenly. We believe the apocalypse will come in December, 2012 and we do not want to be in the great burning.
To separate ourselves from the sinners and survive the reaping, we follow a strict program.<br />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Our program consists of worship every weekday starting at dawn. We emerge from our rooms and fast until dinner. Adam 1
has individiaul conferences with each of us and counsels us on our personal spiritual journey. Weekends consist of special
days. Ritual days, sacrifice days, blood days, and feast days happen each month on the weekends. We are always on the search
for new members!
